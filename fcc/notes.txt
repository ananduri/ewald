again, problem of not invariant wrt alpha

realsum is probably correct? verify this, so can focus on recsum

if realsum is probably correct, then Ewald(+selfenergy) is probably correct
for small alpha. have to get large alpha value (ie recsum) to match that

just b/c invariant with alpha, does it mean its right?
both could be off by same factor (is this true? b/c of selfint?).
more precisely realsum could be off by same factor as (recsum+selfint)

selfint value is pretty ironclad

but is there more insidious errors???

only writing until index 4192??
indexing in last line of realsum/recsum is wrong
yeah i forgot to change value of N in recsum/realsum

am going to have to compute only top half
especially since now want to introduce disorder; if only top half, dont need
to keep track of couplings, can generate them on the fly

how to do top half only? ordinarily have j>i. here need u>x, v>y, ... q>p
dont feel like making sure this works out at the moment

with disorder, might make more sense to compute energies on the fly instead of
before

disorder definitely results in glassy behavior when its big.
whats the smallest disorder can put in which will give glassy? even epsilon?

different nature of disorder on J and D?

time scale is off by ~factor 2 from J&H paper. that seems like too much.
have to identify factor of 16. or could it be 4 and 4? selfint seems to say
no, lets try
also try modifying the kvectors? and whether there is double counting


going to really test results by calculating madelung constants

for madelung, positive or negative is determined by position in basis. NaCl is
FCC basis with 2point basis, or SC with 8point basis. try all of these
