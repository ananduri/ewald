going to really test results by calculating madelung constants

for madelung, positive or negative is determined by position in basis. NaCl is
FCC basis with 2point basis, or SC with 8point basis. try all of these

have correct number (pretty sure) for NaCl, for alpha really small (proves
realsum is correct, and easier to code

have it correct, it seems. dont need to do weird reciprocal lattice stuff if
doing FCC (also basis)

trying to get it for CsCl as well
why am off by factor of sqrt(3) for CsCl? but had it exactly right for Nacl?

how does nearest neighbor enter this calculation
answer: E = M/r0, where r0 is distance to nearest neighbor (of other kind)

even for zincblende. energy is too low by factor of 1/2. 

SOLVED: factor of half comes from fact that Ewald sum is for total energy, so
sum is done over every pair of charges. but both i and j sums go over all
indices, so a factor of half is implicitly included. this was unwittingly kept
when I set i=0 and did a sum over only 1 ion to get madelung. so the madelung
calculations work.
