going to really test results by calculating madelung constants

for madelung, positive or negative is determined by position in basis. NaCl is
FCC basis with 2point basis, or SC with 8point basis. try all of these

have correct number (pretty sure) for NaCl, for alpha really small (proves
realsum is correct, and easier to code

have it correct, it seems. dont need to do weird reciprocal lattice stuff if
doing FCC (also basis)

use madeling to tell how far should go with realcut and reccut to converge

realsum should be completely right.

its matching up again. only tricky part was including the 4pi*pi in dipole dot
prods in recsum.

seeming to give same total energy as before. will see if intmat, and decays,
match up too
